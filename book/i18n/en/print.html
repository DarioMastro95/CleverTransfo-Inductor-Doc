<h2 id="introduction-3"><a class="header" href="#introduction-3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The bulging of the winding is the multiplicative factor applied to the theoretical winding thickness to reach the actual winding thickness required.
This parameter depends on the type of winding machines available in the company and how they work. Generally, in order to determine the bulging coefficient under various conditions, a series of sample windings must be defined. This includes measuring their real thickness and calculating the ratio between the real thickness and that which was theoretically calculated.
Establishing the real winding thickness is particularly important as it leads to determining accuracy in the calculation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-circuit voltage</li>
<li>Load voltage</li>
<li>Losses in the conductors and consequently overtemperature in the various winding sections</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the table, you can define the bulging coefficient depending on the type, material and thickness of the conductor.<br>
<strong>Using the "+" or "-" buttons in the navigator at the top right, you can insert rows to achieve greater granularity or delete rows if required fewer details.</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Under construction parameters, you will find all the tables that define the various design parameters. They can be used to design each type of element in an optimised way.<br>
<strong>The PROFESSIONAL version of Clever Suite includes tables with standard values that may be quite different from the proportions you use in your company. Optimisation varies according to financial, geographical, and time-based conditions within which each company operates.</strong>
Therefore, it is paramount to compare the data supplied with your internal optimisation and carefully evaluate the values to be entered into the applications in order to obtain the best design at the lowest cost for all the various element types and relevant power.<br>
For each type of element and each power, it is a matter of defining which geometric parameters lead to the greatest advantage in financial terms.<br>
Clever applications will automatically adapt your established geometric parameters and allow you to design elements as optimised as possible straightaway.<br></p>
<p>For large elements, there are two tables: one for elements built with the non-oriented grain (<strong>NO</strong>) magnetic sheet and one for oriented grain (<strong>GO</strong>) magnetic sheet. This is because in these two cases, the proportioning is generally quite different.
<strong>Other tables, to define different parameters for special constructions, can be inserted on request.</strong> <br>
All dimensions in the tables are expressed in mm. unless explicitly stated.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-5"><a class="header" href="#introduction-5">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The tables in this section are named <strong>'technical tables'</strong> and contain all the materials that are used in the construction of the designed elements. There is a technical table for each <strong>group</strong> of materials. As illustrated in the forthcoming, the electrical and/or dimensional data required for the component being designed must be entered in these tables. If there are different sub-families within a table, they must be identified by a code. When choosing the code, follow the instructions in the help section of the specific table. Finally, you must enter <strong>the article code</strong> that you use in your management system.
Bear in mind that the list of materials in your warehouse is imported onto <strong>Clever Suite</strong> and can be found under <strong>"Material cost".</strong> The article code from the technical tables will allow applications to find the component on the imported list under <strong>"Material cost"</strong>, thus retrieving your official description and its cost. These will be used at the design stage to compile the <strong>bill of materials</strong> and to calculate the <strong>total cost of materials.</strong><br>
In the initial installation, the tables are pre-filled with materials that we consider standard. This will shorten your data entry work and provide an example of how to enter the data. However, you can subsequently edit, delete, and add rows as you require.
<strong>It is important to carry out the configuration phase thoroughly as it will determine the quality of your future work.</strong></p>

<p>This is a measure/value table that allows you to enter, for a specified carpentry, each component, measure and the value of that measure for each magnetic steel width.
Within the standard, the applications cover the range of magnetic steel width from 40 to 200, with an increase of 5 mm. It is possible to enter all the core widths available, as low as minus 40 and/or as high as above 200.
The option of sorting the table by any column, including multiple selections - by holding down the CTRL key while selecting the various columns - makes it easy to compile and check. If a core width is added, values must be entered for all the dimensions that identify each component of the carpentry involved. To modify existing values, it is necessary to identify the area of the table using the filter at the top left and the order by clicking on the column header.

<p>Generally, the air gap defined in the calculation phase seldom corresponds to the air gap that can be realistically achieved with the insulating materials available. This table defines the possible air gaps based on the standard materials available. Once an optimal air gap has been defined, the applications read this table, choose the closest air gap, and use it, making all the relevant corrections (head air gap, internal air gaps, etc.) so as to obtain an accurate total air gap. This system prevents the air gap data in the technical documentation from having to be corrected manually. In addition, the materials in question will be available in the necessary quantities in the bill of materials.
Limits: the envisaged compositions allow the combination of up to two different insulating materials, each with up to <strong>three sheets or plate in parallel.</strong>
Depending on your availability, you can modify this table by inserting other materials and deleting or inserting other lines.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-41"><a class="header" href="#introduction-41">Introduction:</a></h2>
<p>This table is used by the applications to determine the description and the unit cost of the materials that will compose the bill of materials. A list of <strong>generic</strong> materials is available by default, You have also the possibility of importing all the information relating to all your <strong>specific items</strong> available in your <strong>management system.</strong><br>
In fact, when they cannot find the specific material, the applications use the list of generic materials to determine the unit cost and the description of the component they are designing.
Please note that the generic materials in the table are given an article number starting with the letter Z and are blue. The list of generic materials includes all groups of materials that are used by the applications. Obviously, from a dimensional point of view, they contain unit costs associated with size ranges with rather coarse limits; otherwise, the list would be too long and difficult to keep up to date. On the other hand, it is important to allow applications to calculate the material cost of an item accurately, including when you are designing special items that need materials unavailable in the company's stock. Hence:</p>
<ol>
<li>the first task is to enter the unit cost for each line, in accordance with the unit of measurement indicated.</li>
<li>The second task will be  to import the liste of the material available in your warehouse and listed in your management system</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conductor-related-details-for-generic-materials"><a class="header" href="#conductor-related-details-for-generic-materials">Conductor-related details for generic materials:</a></h3>
<p>In general, the cost of conductors can be divided into basic cost and transformation cost. You will find in the table these two items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic conductor AL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic conductor CU</strong>
For each type of conductor there is another item: the transformation cost:<br>
<em><strong>Example:
Conductor wire AL &lt;= 2.5
or
Conductor foil CU</strong></em><br>
If you enter a basic cost, applications will take this as the basic conductor cost and add it to the transformation cost when calculating the material cost. If you want your conductor cost to consist of a basic cost and a transformation cost, enter the base and transformation costs as described. On the other hand, if you wish to manage a single cost, enter 0 in the basic cost and enter the entire cost in the <strong>transformation field.
NB: If entered, the basic cost is added also to the cost of conductors with specific items.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Unit cost</strong>: here enter the unit cost in accordance with the unit of measurement</li>
<li><strong>Article</strong>: assigned article (read-only field)</li>

<h3 id="entry-of-specific-materials"><a class="header" href="#entry-of-specific-materials">Entry of specific materials:</a></h3>
<p>In addition to entering generic costs, as mentioned above,  you can import the entire list of materials that are available in your management system. Here is how to proceed:</p>
<h4 id="export-the-material-data-on-the-management-system-side"><a class="header" href="#export-the-material-data-on-the-management-system-side">Export the material data on the management system side:</a></h4>
<p>Extract from the management application a table with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column 1 = ARTICLE</li>
<li>Column 2 = DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Column 3 = UNIT OF MEASURE</li>
<li>Column 4 = Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>and save it as a file with the extension .csv (readable with Excel).
Check, by opening the file with an editor (Notepad for example) that the separator character between the columns is ";". If not, define this rule at the export level.
You can ask your IT department, in charge of the management system, to create this file and save it in a folder accessible to you.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>
It is possible to extract the entire list of materials (not only those used in the design) as the applications will only use the items listed in the technical material tables.
In the initial set-up stage, you must decide which price column to use to export (average price or last price or etc.). This is a decision that has a major impact on the result of the cost calculation.</p>
<h4 id="importing-material-data-into-clever-applications"><a class="header" href="#importing-material-data-into-clever-applications">Importing material data into Clever applications:</a></h4>
<p>Once you have obtained the .csv file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the 'Import' button at the top right of this table.</li>
<li>Choose the file from the dialogue box that appears as a file exported from the management system.</li>
<li>Again from the opened dialogue box, click on Open (bottom right)</li>
<li>This will automatically import the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the periodic update of the cost of generic materials, it is possible to proceed in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The technical department takes charge of updating the cost directly in this table, as was done the first time. In this case, only the specific items are imported from the management system.</li>
<li>Generic materials are also loaded into the management system, which must be managed as virtual articles (without physical location and with quantity = 0). In this case, the management department will be responsible for updating the costs of generic materials. The materials import file will also include the generics and you only have to regularly import the file from the management system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever the choice, it is desirable to create a management-side procedure, which automatically exports to a defined folder readable by the technical department regularly (i.e. every week or even every day). In this way, there are the right prerequisites to be able to import up-to-date costs at any time.</p>
<h4 id="table-reading-facilities"><a class="header" href="#table-reading-facilities">Table reading facilities:</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>As in any other table, you can use the <strong>filter</strong> in the top left-hand corner to search for a material family or a specific material or change the sorting of the columns.</li>
<li>If the material cost is = 0, it is marked in <strong>red.</strong></li>
<li>If you see an article coloured <strong>red</strong> in the specific tables you have previously filled in, it means that there is no corresponding article in “Material costs” table.</li>
