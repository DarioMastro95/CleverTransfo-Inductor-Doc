# Electrical parameters

## Introduction
Here you can define some parameters that are involved in the electrical calculation or mechanical design, specific to each company.
### Insulator overhang at the side of the coils (mm)
Enter the insulator overhang between the coil in the case of foil winding. This value will then be set automatically in the designs. It only applies to foil conductors as the set overhang for strip and wire conductors is always 0.<br>
For all conductor types, it is possible to change the set value throughout the project.

### Flat wire insulation thickness (mm)

The flat wire can be enamelled or Nomex insulated. Depending on the type of insulation, the thickness of the insulation changes.
Enter the chosen thickness here.


### Conductor waste factor
The winding weight can be increased by entering the multiplication factor here. In the technical specification and winding weight calculation, the exact theoretical weight will still be given.


#### Example

| Field                        | Value                         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Theoretical conductor weight             | 10.00 kg                       |
| Waste factor                | 1.03                         |
| Weight in the bill of materials and cost                   | 10.30 kg                                     |

### Core waste factor
The same principle applies to core weight, as above.
