# Default isolation definition

## Introduction

This table defines the default insulation material and thickness, which it uses as insulation between core and coil and between windings, when the designer has not defined any interlayer insulation. The choice depends on the temperature class chosen. <br>
Otherwise, however, i.e. if the designer has defined the interlayer insulation in some windings, the applications will ensure that the insulation between windings and between core and coil are equal to that of the interlayers.<br>
Using this table you can modify the default data by inserting those that best match your design rules.<br>



### Table fields (Heat shrink tapes)

- **Temperature Class**: temperature class for which the material and thickness introduced here are chosen.
- **Material**: abbreviation of the material. By opening the drop-down menu in the Material field you see the list of all available materials and you can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Insulation thickness**: default insulation thickness.
