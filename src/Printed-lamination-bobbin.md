# Printed lamination - bobbin /<br>
This standardisation requires aluminium windings and NO grain not oriented laminations. For different conditions, the proportioning is not optimised.
### Table Fields  (Printed lamination - bobbin)
- **Std.**: element type coding, which must be strictly adhered to. If a new type of element is to be added, you must contact us for the choice of code. Here are the meanings of the letters used:<br>
IDC = single-phase DC inductors<br>
IAC = single-phase AC inductors<br>
TR  = three-phase and single-phase Transformers <br>
- **Phases nr.**: 1 = single-phase  3 = three-phase.
- **Power VA**: dimensioning power of the element in VA.
- **Printed lam. code**: Printed lamination type (ex: EIT , EI , UI)
- **Printed lam. length**: Printed lamination Length.
- **Flux density T**: recommended flux density (for NO core) .
- **Core section cm2**: section of the core (column) which is calculated as follows: **Core width x Core thickness x 0.97**. <br>
**0.97** gives the actual cross-section, after deducting the spaces occupied by the insulation of the individual laminations.
- **Core Width**: the width of the core sheet of the column (The core thickness is calculated automatically by the application, starting from the core section, taking into account the formula above).
- **Core thickness**: The core thickness is calculated from the raw core section. Must be consistent with core section and core width.
- **Window width**: The window width is the space between the columns. In this case, once the of the printed lamination has been chosen, it is a fixed value.
- **Window height**: window height is defined as the space between the two yokes. In this case, once the of the printed lamination has been chosen, it is a fixed value.
- **Front. core/coil ch.**: thickness of the frontal space between core and coil. The thickness of the bobbin plus any frontal channel can be inserted.
- **Side core/coil ch.**: thickness of the side space between core and coil. The thickness of the bobbin can be inserted. It is not possible to insert a side ventilation channel for this kind of element.
- **Bobbin type**: Bobbin identification according to suppliers' rules.
- **Winding height**: Net height available for windings (all windings are set to the same height).
- **Channel between wdgs**: thickness of the front channel between the windings. This channel is used between the primary and secondary. 
- **Partwdg int. windings**: No. of partwindings of the internal winding.
- **Channel int. windings.**: thickness of the frontal channel between partwindings. This channel is used in the internal winding.
- **Partwdg ext. winding**: No. of partwindings of the external winding.
- **Channel ext. winding**: thickness of the frontal channel between partwindings. This channel is used in the external winding.
- **Description**: free descriptions of the type of element being designed are not included in the applications, so you can write descriptions as you see fit.
