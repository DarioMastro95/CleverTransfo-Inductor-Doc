# Construction parameters

## Introduction

Under construction parameters, you will find all the tables that define the various design parameters. They can be used to design each type of element in an optimised way.<br>
**The PROFESSIONAL version of Clever Suite includes tables with standard values that may be quite different from the proportions you use in your company. Optimisation varies according to financial, geographical, and time-based conditions within which each company operates.**
Therefore, it is paramount to compare the data supplied with your internal optimisation and carefully evaluate the values to be entered into the applications in order to obtain the best design at the lowest cost for all the various element types and relevant power.<br>
For each type of element and each power, it is a matter of defining which geometric parameters lead to the greatest advantage in financial terms.<br>
Clever applications will automatically adapt your established geometric parameters and allow you to design elements as optimised as possible straightaway.<br>

For large elements, there are two tables: one for elements built with the non-oriented grain (**NO**) magnetic sheet and one for oriented grain (**GO**) magnetic sheet. This is because in these two cases, the proportioning is generally quite different.
**Other tables, to define different parameters for special constructions, can be inserted on request.** <br>
All dimensions in the tables are expressed in mm. unless explicitly stated.
