# U profiles


## Introduction
U-profiles can be used for the vertical clamping of elements or as a base profile.  
They can be made of bent steel or UNP (as shown in the drawing above). They essentially differ in the type of material. The choice depends essentially on the installation environment. They are semi-finished products.
