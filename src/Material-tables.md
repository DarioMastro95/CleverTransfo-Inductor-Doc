# Material tables

## Introduction
The sub-menu tables contain all the materials that are used in the construction of the designed elements. There is one table for each group.<br>
Each table must contain a list of the items that are used. 
As you will see later, you must enter the electrical and/or dimensional data required to fully define the component under consideration.<br>
If there are different sub-families within a table, these are identified by a code. When choosing the code, please follow the instructions in the help section of each table.
Finally, you must enter the article code that you use in your management system.<br>
Consider that, as illustrated in the figure below, the list of materials in your warehouse is imported into Clever Suite and this article will allow applications to retrieve your official description and the cost of the material once the component is found on this list.
In the first installation, the tables have already been filled with materials that we consider standard. This will shorten your data entry work and provide an example of how to enter data. You of course have the freedom to edit, delete and add rows as required. It is important to take care of this configuration phase because it determines the quality of your future work.
