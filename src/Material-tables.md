# Material tables

## Introduction
The tables in this section are named **'technical tables'** and contain all the materials that are used in the construction of the designed elements. There is a technical table for each **group** of materials. As illustrated in the forthcoming, the electrical and/or dimensional data required for the component being designed must be entered in these tables. If there are different sub-families within a table, they must be identified by a code. When choosing the code, follow the instructions in the help section of the specific table. Finally, you must enter **the article code** that you use in your management system.
Bear in mind that the list of materials in your warehouse is imported onto **Clever Suite** and can be found under **"Material cost".** The article code from the technical tables will allow applications to find the component on the imported list under **"Material cost"**, thus retrieving your official description and its cost. These will be used at the design stage to compile the **bill of materials** and to calculate the **total cost of materials.**<br>
In the initial installation, the tables are pre-filled with materials that we consider standard. This will shorten your data entry work and provide an example of how to enter the data. However, you can subsequently edit, delete, and add rows as you require. 
**It is important to carry out the configuration phase thoroughly as it will determine the quality of your future work.**
