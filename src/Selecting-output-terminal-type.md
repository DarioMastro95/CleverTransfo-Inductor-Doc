# Selecting output terminal type

### Introduction
This table defines the type of output terminal that the applications will choose automatically, according to the following parameters:
- **Type of conductor** 
- **Rating current**
- **Rating voltage**


### Table fields (Select output term. type)

- **Conductor type**: enter the conductor type according to the following code:<br>
1 = Flat wire <br>
2 = Foil<br>
3 = Wire <br>
4 = Multi wire<br>
In case the output type is valid for more than one conductor, enter 1 code in sequence.<br>
***Esempio:
Example:
If the output type is valid for both wire and flat wire enter: 13
.***
- **Max current A**: maximum rated current for which that type of output can be used.
- **Max voltage V**: maximum rated voltage for which that type of output can be used.
- **Output terminal type**: output terminal type code: <br>
1 = Terminal blocks in lists <br>
2 = minal blocks on rail <br>
3 = Lugs <br>
4 = External bars (used when the winding is in flat wire, but the current does not allow for
       the use of lugs). 
       They are bars fixed to a plate or an insulator to which the flat wire, coming off the coil, is welded.<br>
5 = Bars inside the foil winding.
- **Description**: the description of the type of output is inserted in the table for clarity.
