# Winding insulation

## Introduction
This table defines the total thickness of the insulation layer to be interposed between the windings according to the maximum insulation voltage admitted. The  applications use the type and thickness of the interlayer insulation and calculate the number of turns required to reach the thickness given in the table. If there were no interlayers, applications would use a default material depending on the temperature class - a thickness between 0.18 and 0.25, depending on the standard thicknesses available.

### Table fields (Winding insulation)

- **Total insulation thickness**: required insulation thickness.
- **U insulation KV**: maximum insulation voltage.
