# Magnetic steel


## Introduction


This table lists the available magnetic steels. It is possible to indicate the dimensions of both the sheet supplied in coil form and the sheet supplied already cut to standardised lengths. The number of holes must be entered for the sheet already cut to distinguish its use in yokes or columns. The type could be deduced from the material but has been entered for immediate information.



### Table fields (magnetic steel)

- **Material**: material abbreviation. By opening the drop-down menu of the Material field, you see a list of all available materials and can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Thickness**: enter the thickness of the magnetic steel.
- **Type**: taken from the material, you enter the abbreviation currently used to identify that magnetic steel.
***Example: NOM270***.
- **Width**: width of the magnetic steel that corresponds to the width of the column in which it is used.
- **Length**: here you can enter either the length of the semi-finished product (if you purchase in rolls in STD dimensions and cut at the factory) or all available lengths if you purchase already cut to size. The applications check if the exact size exists. If it does not exist they search for the semi-finished product.
- **Nr. holes**: the number of holes for the passage of tie rods. Only for magnet steel cut to length and used for yokes.
- **Article**: to select the material, use the article code of your management system. This value will allow the applications to retrieve the description and unit cost into the table Material Unit Cost by importing the list of materials available in your warehouse.
