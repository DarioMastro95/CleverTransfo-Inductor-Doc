# Insulating sheets

## Introduction
Insulating sheets differ from each other in the type of material they are made of. The choice depends on the temperature class and, in some cases, on the standard to which the element is subjected.

### Table fields (Insulating sheets)

- **Material**: material abbreviation. By opening the drop-down menu of the ***Material field***, you see a list of all available materials and can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Thickness**: enter the thickness of the insulation sheet.
- **Kg/m2**: it is recommended to obtain this parameter from the supplier's tables. Otherwise, it must be calculated from the thickness and specific weight of the material.
- **Width**: here you can enter both the width of the semi-finished product (if you purchase rolls in STD dimensions and cut in ) and all widths corresponding to the various heights (if you purchase already-cut-to-standard sizes). The applications check if the exact size exists. If it does not exist, they look for a semi-finished product.
- **Article**: to select the material, use the article code of your management system. This value will allow the applications to retrieve the description and unit cost into the table Material Unit Cost by importing the list of materials available in your warehouse.
