# Users

## Introduction
This table allows you to input all the users who will use the applications. 
The **number of users** does not necessarily have to coincide with the number of licenses.  
The **number of licenses** only limits the number of simultaneous accesses to Clever Suite.



## Example
*A company that has purchased three licenses can install Clever Suite on more than three computers and the number of users can be greater than three, as long as no more than three designers are working simultaneously at any time.*


## Table fields
- **UserName**: it is an abbreviation of the user’s full name and may include a maximum of two characters in capital letters. 
- **Name**: it is the first name of the user. The first letter is capitalised.
- **Surname**: it is the user's surname. The first letter is capitalised.
- **Role**: designs’ roles within the application can either be **admin or user.** In a company, there must only be one admin. All other operators must be user. Only the **admin** can access and modify the configuration options and he is the person responsible for the configuration of Clever Suite.
