# Interlayer insulation thick

## Introduction
This table is used only in Clever Small-T and Clever Small-I applications to choose automatically the thickness of the insulation between layers and between windings.
The thicknesses automatically chosen by the applications, within a design, can be changed manually.

### Table fields (Interlayer insulation)

- **Temperature class**:
Element temperature class (A-E-B-F-H).
- **Conductor material**:
Conductor material code.<br>
0 = Aluminum<br>
1 = Copper<br>
- **Conductor type**:
Enter the conductor type according to the following code:<br>
1 = Flat wire<br>
2 = Foil<br>
3 = Wire<br>
4 = Multi-wire<br>
- **Nr. of // radial conductors**:
Number of conductors in radial parallel. With the same thickness, the thickness of the insulation generally has to be increased if there are more conductors in // radial.
- **Conductor thickness**:
The thickness of the single conductor.
- **Insulation thickness**:
Suitable insulation thickness. No distinctions are made among the various insulating materials because the problem is mainly mechanical.
- **Index**:
Value needed by the software.
If you need to add a line, proceed as follows:<br>
    - Sort the table by index to find out the latest number
    - Enter the next number as per the index.
