# Thermo shrink ribbons

## Introduction
Thermo shrink ribbons are used for the external wrapping of coils. During vacuum-impregnation of the coil, they shrink due to the effect of heating, thus contributing to the compactness of the coil. They differ from one other mainly in the type of material. The choice depends on the temperature class and, in some cases, also on the environment in which they are installed.
