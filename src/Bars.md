# Bars

## Introduction
Aluminium or copper bars are used as winding output terminals and can be welded directly onto the conductor foil or be welded externally to the coil in the case of a flat wire or wire. In the latter two cases, their function will be similar to the lug or clamp. The bars are semi-finished products which will be cut to size and/or shaped as required.
The output and connection bars are dimensioned following the **thermal current** flowing through them, in accordance with the DIN limits.
The table shows the correlation between the **maximum admitted current** and the **type of bar.**
A distinction is made between bars constituting a customer connection, which are dimensioned using the values given in the column **"maximum current client side"** as maximum current, the bars internal to the coil - whose maximum current corresponds to **"maximum current winding side"** - and those connecting bars whose maximum current corresponds to **"maximum connection current".**


### Table fields (Bars)
- **Material**: material abbreviation.By opening the drop-down menu of the ***Material field***, you see a list of all available materials and can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Width**: width of the bar.
- **Thickness**: the thickness of the bar.
- **Section mm2**: section of bar Width x Thickness (bars are sharp-edged).  
- **I max winding side**: maximum admitted current for winding output bars that are not used directly as a customer connection. 
**Example**: output bar of a single-phase element with a parallel connection. 
- **I max connection side**: Maximum permissible current for connection bars which are not used directly as a customer connection.
**Example**: connection bar of a three-phase element with a triangle connection.
- **I max client side**: maximum admitted current for bars that are used directly as a customer connection.
- **Article**: to select the material, use the article code of your management system. This value will allow the applications to retrieve the description and unit cost into the table ***Material Unit Cost*** by importing the list of materials available in your warehouse.
