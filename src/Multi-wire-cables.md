# Multi wire cables

## Introduction
Cables are either class B or F or H insulated multi-wire conductors that can be used as the output terminals of a shield (in which case they will be yellow/green). They may also used in small wire coils, welded to the conductors to connect the terminal blocks. In the latter case, the external insulation will be made of different materials depending on the temperature class and may have different colours to comply with the colour codes defined by the company.

### Table fields (multi wire cables)
- **Rating current A**: it is the maximum current allowed.
- **External diameter**: external diameter - usually available from suppliers' tables. This is not mandatory, it can also be omitted.
- **Insulating voltage KV**: maximum insulation voltage admitted for the cable. The applications compare this value with the insulation voltage of the element.
- **Code**: this coding is used to distinguish the type of insulation. LSIL = Silicone is the standard. For other materials, additional codes must be defined but must be recognised by the design rule that selects the cable and enters it in the bill of materials. Hence, we require the definition of other codes in the customisation phase of the application.
- **Material**: material abbreviation. By opening the drop-down menu of the Material field you see the list of all available materials and can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Section mm2**: conductor section. This information is mandatory.
- **Colour**: colour of the insulating sheath.
- **Article**: to select the material, use the article code of your management system. This value will allow the applications to retrieve the description and unit cost into the table Material Unit Cost by importing the list of materials available in your warehouse.
