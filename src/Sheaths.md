# Sheaths

## Introduction
Sheaths are used to insulate the section of the conductor coming out of the winding to the output terminal (terminal block or lug).<br>
They are tubes that exist in various colours which the company can associate with precise codes. They are usually semi-finished products.
The type of material from which they are made mainly depends on the temperature class and insulation voltage of the element.


### Table fields (Sheaths)

- **Insulation voltage KV**: maximum insulation voltage that the sheath can withstand.
- **Code**: code identifying the sheath. Generally, expresses the use of the sheath itself:
UL = valid only for UL standards, GSI = valid for general elements class B, LSI = conduit all elements class F - H.

- **Material**: material abbreviation. By opening the drop-down menu of the Material field, you see a list of all available materials and can choose the correct abbreviation.
- **Internal diameter**: the inner diameter of the sheat.
- **Colour**: write the colour in full and in capital letters.
- **Article**: to select the material, use the article code of your management system. This value will allow the applications to retrieve the description and unit cost into the table Material Unit Cost by importing the list of materials available in your warehouse.
