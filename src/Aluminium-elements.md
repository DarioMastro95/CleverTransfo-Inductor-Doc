# Generic elements

### Table Fields ( Generic elements and UL elements)

-   **Norm**: element type coding, which must be strictly respected. If a new element type is to be added, you must contact us for the code.
-   **Phases nr.**: no. of phases of the element.
-   **Power VA**: dimensioning power of the element in VA.
-   **Flux density T**: recommended flux density (for NO core)
-   **Type printed lamination EI**: printed lamination used (external dimension).
-   **Spec. core losses W/kg**: grade of the magnetic steel used for this table (example: 1.7 , 1.3 or other).
-   **Core section cm2**: core section (column) which is calculated as follows:<br>
    Core width x Core thickness x 0.965
    <br> gives the actual section, less the spaces occupied by the insulation of the individual laminations.
-   **Core thickness**: must be consistent with core section and core width.
-   **Core width**: width of the central core colunm.
-   **Core weight kg**: total core weight.
-   **Window width**: window width is the space between the columns or between the central column and the side column. In this case, once the of the printed lamination has been chosen, it is a fixed value.
-   **Window height**: window height is the space between the two yokes. In this case, once the of the printed lamination has been chosen, it is a fixed value.
-   **Bobbin type**: bobbin identification in accordance with supplier identification.
-   **Winding height**: winding height available on the bobbin.
-   **Winding thick.**: thickness available in the bobbin for the winding.
-   **Bobbin perimeter**: internal perimeter of the bobbin, starting data for the calculation of the average length og the winding.
-   **Bobbin thick.**: bobbin wall thickness.
